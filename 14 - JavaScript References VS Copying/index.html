    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Tobby';
    console.log(players, team);

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team2);
    team3[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team3);
    team4[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team4);

    // Another way!!!
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 59, age: 12});
    console.log(person, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',

    };
    // Oh no!!
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(wes.social, dev.social);

    // Solution... not that good
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.social.twitter = '@welcome';
    console.log(wes.social, dev2.social);
